If you use makebakery, I'd like to add your website to this list. Please e-mail me or send a pull request!

# Other Make-based approaches

If makebakery seems a bit over-engineered, you might find inspiration from these projects, which also use `make` in some capacity for building static sites:

- [chrisman/m4-blog](https://github.com/chrisman/m4-blog) combines make, pandoc, and gnu m4 to generate [Chrisman Brown's blog](). It is similar to what I used to do before makebakery.

- [technomancy.us](https://technomancy.us/) Phil Hagelberg a.k.a. technomancy publishes his site using "GNU M4, rsync, and a 12-line Makefile."
  Technomancy is also the creator of [Leiningen](https://leiningen.org/) (which I use every day) and the [Atreus keyboard](https://atreus.technomancy.us/) (I own both a classic atreus and a keyboardio atreus.)
